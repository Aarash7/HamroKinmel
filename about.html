        <section class="project-description">
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>TechMart Pro is a comprehensive e-commerce website built as part of a web development assignment. This project demonstrates modern web development practices including responsive design, interactive user interfaces, and complete e-commerce functionality.</p>
            <p>Integrating a live interface made a great addition to our project as the user can be more engaged with real-time updates and smooth transitions. With additions such as rendered live product, a scroll-to-top button, and an interactive theme toggle, we combined design and functional-focused features seamlessly. For example, the modular design of the navigation bar, which was dynamically loaded from separate HTML, displays our use of reusable components and async JS that improved maintainability and performance</p>
            <p>Moreover, we will demonstrate how we can use local storage securely and efficiently for user authentication and user preferences, without using a server-side database. We were trying to highlight how to ensure a balance between simplicity and functionality with web applications in an innovative way with this aspect of the project.</p>

        <section class="challenges-faced">
            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>A lot of the complexity came from dynamic content loading, especially with routing components that had to be loaded on the fly and then function properly, as we had to make sure that our event listeners attached correctly to the new DOM elements. That in turn meant orchestrating when the scripts ran as well as persisting state through page reloads. Asynchronous operations and event bindings are easy to appreciate in concept, but difficult in practice — this was a valuable experience, but it was at times demanding as debugging and tracing changes are never as trivial as they seem when you have developed the entire workflow in JavaScript already; ultimately though, it introduced us to modern JavaScript JavaScript and greatly developed our understanding of how it works.</p>
            <p>Another painpoint was making the night mode theme toggle visually consistent and accessible across the whole site. This required careful CSS overrides (most components were styled in their own way) to ensure balance between usability and aesthetics and that everything correctly responded to a change in theme. It also involved plenty of communication and collaboration skills by coordinating with team members on code integrations to ensure that code remains uniform, all the while fulfilling our respective roles.</p>
